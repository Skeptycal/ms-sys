This will be done before version 1.0, public release:

1. Put this program on the web (sourceforge?) and announce it on freshmeat.
2. Update readme, add download site and contact email.

This might be done for future releases:

1. Add boot records for other file systems and OSes, FAT16? IBM PC-DOS?
   To do this I will need documentation and someone willing to test the new
   features.

2. Add more translations, contributions are welcome!
